			<h1>Red Bull</h1>
			<p>Red Bull was working on two big initiatives &mdash; the <i>Artograph</i> and the <i>After Party</i> &mdash; with a digital agency based in Brooklyn. As the agency's interaction designer, I worked with another designer and developer to create the front-end.</p>
			<p>The Artograph allowed sponsored athletes to digitally sign autographs onto images uploaded by their fans. I designed the interface of the Artograph's management system from the athlete's POV. Athletes were able to choose a photo to sign from a list of submissions, a signature style and color and resize. If a photo included a message from the fan, the athlete could respond.</p>
			<p>The After Party was a library of photo galleries of major Red Bull sponsored. The key feature was allowing fans to use Facebook to tag themselves or friends in a photo. I handled the UX for the dashboard, and assisted with art direction.</p>
