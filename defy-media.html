			<h1>Defy Media</h1>
			<p>At Alloy Digital, I was a lead designer for <a href="http://www.smosh.com">Smosh</a> &mdash; one of the top-viewed comedy channels in YouTube history &mdash; to help rebuild the website and native mobile apps. The Smosh duo Ian and Anthony loved bright colors and pixel art; so we revamped the art direction. We debuted game mechanics driven by a revenue goal to rely less on ads and more on audience engagement. For example: If a user wanted to advance levels quickly, he/she can purchase more tokens. It was an interesting challenge to take on for a small team. (I actually did a short talk at a Brooklyn meetup to gain more insights.)</p>
			<p>After the site's deploy, Alloy Digital merged with Break Media to form DEFY Media. During the transition, I worked remotely with the VP of creative services based in Los Angeles on various client and internal initiatives. Included was developing style guides for each of our 10+ properties, as their precedents lacked a unified look.</p>
